# Cloud-Project
Purpose and Goals
The primary objective of this project is to create a sentiment analysis system using Azure services :
1.	Developing an API endpoint for users/customers to submit feedback/comments easily.
2.	Storing user feedback in a scalable and secure storage solution.
3.	Leveraging Azure AI services to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the comments.
4.	Creating a data pipeline where raw comments are processed, and enriched feedback analysis is stored for visualization and reporting.
5.	Learning Azure services capabilities, building a reusable cloud-based solution for similar tasks in the future.
